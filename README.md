William Bandasiewicz's Project 4:

Features:

1. The main purpose of the wesbite is to allow the user to create custom Fire Emblem characters by entering a name, appearance description, and four stats (HP, Strength, Magic, and Skill).
2. All created characters appear as clickable cards in a list on the home page.
3. New characters appear at the top of the list.
4. Clicking any character card navigates to a page showing the character's full info.
5. Character data persists across browser sessions using localStorage, so characters remain saved even after closing the browser. (is in character.ts in the loadInitial() function)
6. The site includes an About page explaining how to use the site.
7. The form resets automatically after submitting a new character.
